  abstract={Bipedal locomotion is a challenging control task to learn due to the high dimensionality
    of the action and state vectors and the partially observable and non-linear nature of the
    agent's dynamics. In this thesis, we primarily focus on locomotion in bipedal robots like
    Cassie with the help of model-based reinforcement learning. First, we approximate the
    dynamics of a bipedal robot with a novel transformer model. Upon effectively training
    the transformer model, we deployed it in a zeroth-order planner to control a bipedal
    robot. However, due to the inability of zeroth-order planners to scale with the action's
    dimensionality, we devised a novel first-order planner and robust model retraining
    methods which could circumvent these problems and result in stable locomotion. Over
    the course of this thesis, we hope to motivate this problem and support the success of
    our methods with experimental results in simulation.},
