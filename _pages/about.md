Hi!
I'm Sai Advaith Maddipatla. You can call me Advaith.

I'm a research assistant at [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/) under [Prof. Or Litany](https://orlitany.github.io/).

Broadly I am interested in Deep Learning for 3D vision and generative modelling. My research currently invovles diffusion models, computational imaging, and Neural Radiance Fields.

Previously, I worked extensively on Robotics and Reinforcement Learning problems. I received my BSc (Hons) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) with a first class degree (equivalent to 4.0 GPA) in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. During my junior year, I was an exchange student at [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) (GPA 4.2).

During my undergrad, I was advised by [Professor Subramanian Ramamoorthy](https://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/) and [Professor Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/). My undergraduate thesis focussed on developing novel model-based reinforcement learning methods for bipedal robots.

You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qFok8DgxKcs7atmobA-w4PWi5OvqPr-/view?usp=sharing).
